These small mines feature unfolding spikes that enable them to stick to most surfaces. This incredibly lethal weapon is used for quick area denial and defense, but also leaves behind a highly dangerous field of ordnance, if the mines are not properly cleared afterwards. Its use is prohibited by international treaties."
